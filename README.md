# arduino-uv-sensor
A sketch and schema to utilise the Arduino UV sensor in a project.

### Project goal:

This application currently writes the calculated UV level to serial. To enhance the usability of this project, this data must be stored and shared. 

- This project will seek to provide the most efficient API for people to access this data online
- As an extra part we will create a web page and arduino project examples of how to utlise this information

### Setup:

Please check the datasheet of your UV sensor to ensure you are applying the correct settings.

Connection (using sensor module below):

Pin: A0 to Out
Pin: GND to GND
Pin: 3.3v to VCC

Sensor module used:

### UV information from EPA.gov:

#### UV Index Low - Green
A UV Index reading of 0 to 2 means low danger from the sun's UV rays for the average person.
 
#### Wear sunglasses on bright days.
If you burn easily, cover up and use broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen.
Watch out for bright surfaces, like sand, water and snow, which reflect UV and increase exposure.

#### A UV Index reading of 3 to 5 means moderate risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure.

Stay in shade near midday when the sun is strongest.
If outdoors, wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses.
Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating. 
Watch out for bright surfaces, like sand, water and snow, which reflect UV and increase exposure.

3 to 5: Moderate = UV Index Moderate - Yellow

#### A UV Index reading of 6 to 7 means high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Protection against skin and eye damage is needed.

6 to 7: High UV Index High - Orange

Reduce time in the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
If outdoors, seek shade and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses.
Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating. 
Watch out for bright surfaces, like sand, water and snow, which reflect UV and increase exposure.

#### A UV Index reading of 8 to 10 means very high risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take extra precautions because unprotected skin and eyes will be damaged and can burn quickly.

8 to 10: Very High UV Index Very High - Red

Minimize sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
If outdoors, seek shade and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses.
Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating. 
Watch out for bright surfaces, like sand, water and snow, which reflect UV and increase exposure.

#### A UV Index reading of 11 or more means extreme risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure. Take all precautions because unprotected skin and eyes can burn in minutes. 

11 or more: Extreme UV Index Extreme - Purple

Try to avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

If outdoors, seek shade and wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses.
Generously apply broad spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days, and after swimming or sweating.
Watch out for bright surfaces, like sand, water and snow, which reflect UV and increase exposure.
The Shadow Rule
 
#### An easy way to tell how much UV exposure you are getting is to look for your shadow:

If your shadow is taller than you are (in the early morning and late afternoon), your UV exposure is likely to be lower.
If your shadow is shorter than you are (around midday), you are being exposed to higher levels of UV radiation. Seek shade and protect your skin and eyes.

### Tech Stack:

The tech stack for this project:

- ESP8266 (Arduino open source software)
- UV sensor
- Node JS / Express 
- MongoDB
- Optionally power with solar energy

<!-- - Redis DB -->

<!-- ### Redis: -->

<!-- Turn on:
redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
redis-server /etc/init.d/redis-server stop
redis-server /etc/init.d/redis-server start

launch on load:
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

unload from launch:
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist

Test:
redis-cli ping -->

### Mongo:

Running the database:

- run the Mongo server with the command, mongod
- ensure the server is running before serving the api
- for debugging and checking values were store you can enter the mongo shell via the terminal by typing, mongo

### Express:

Setup and running application:

- cd into the api folder.
- run yarn
- start server with node index.js
